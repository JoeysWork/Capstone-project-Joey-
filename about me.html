    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Joey Pronk, and I am a 22-year-old aspiring web, app, and backend developer. I am passionate about technology and eager to learn and grow in the field of software development.
        I never had anything with computers. I did a study in the hospitality field, after that I went to Veva, which is basically the Dutch military. In the military I was injured, something called "compartment syndrome" 
        long story short, I had to get a surgery and after that I couldn't continue my military career. After that I moved to Barcelona, in Spain. To get back from the rushed life in the Netherlands.
        Here I got my first real full-time job. "Technical support agent" at Worldline, a payment processor. Here I learned a lot about payments, APIs and JSON.
        This job sparked my interest in coding, development, API, webhooks. So in December 2025 I decided that I would start learning the ins and outs of web development.
        After finishing this course, I am planning on getting some real world experience by doing junior developer roles, or an internship. 
        Once I become more experienced, I would love to work on freelance projects and slowly start learning app development and backend development as well.
